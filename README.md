# Databases Project

This repository contains SQL scripts for creating and managing databases, tables, and performing various operations on them. The project focuses on working with bands, albums, and songs, as well as exploring SQL commands and queries.

## Project Files

### 1. **Albums and Bands Workshop.sql**
This script includes:
- Creation of `Bands` and `Albums` tables.
- Insertion of sample data for bands and albums.
- Queries to retrieve, update, and delete data.
- Examples of SQL joins, aggregate functions, and filtering.
- Demonstrates database creation and deletion.

### 2. **Webdev Simplified Workshop.sql**
This script expands on the `Bands` and `Albums` database by:
- Adding a `Songs` table with relationships to albums.
- Inserting detailed data for bands, albums, and songs.
- Advanced queries, including joins, grouping, and aggregate functions.
- Examples of filtering, ordering, and handling NULL values.

### 3. **SUPER HEROS TABLE.sql**
This script demonstrates:
- Creation of a `TestTable` and altering its structure.
- Creation of a modified `Albums` table with a `release_year` as a date.
- Insertion of sample data for bands, including superhero-themed names.
- Queries using `LIKE` for pattern matching and ordering results.

### 4. **revised some commands.sql**
This script includes:
- Creation of a `DEMO` table with sample data.
- Insertion, updating, and deletion of records.
- Demonstrates the use of `SHOW TABLES`, `DROP TABLE`, and `DELETE` commands.
